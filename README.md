Capstone Project for BS in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte - Realtime Strategy Game made in Unity

Nathan Weisskopf - Lead Programmer and Artist | 
Taylor Tomescu - Game Producer and Level Designer | 
Michael Caputo & Grant Weigand - 3D Modeling and Asset Production

Inspired by number of strategy game titles, this capstone project is, to me, a love letter to the genre that I grew up with on my first laptop. It is the culmination of my formal education and personal learning outside of school. -NW
